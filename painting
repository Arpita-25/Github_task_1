Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium[1] to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support"). 
The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. 
The final work is also called a painting.

Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, gesture (as in gestural painting), 
composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art).[2] Paintings can be naturalistic and 
representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), 
emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism).
